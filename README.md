# nosql-challenge
Module 12

## Project Overview:
The analysis of this data was conducted through the usage of a Mongo database wihtin a Jupyter Notebook file. Within the Jupyter Notebook file, the work was split into three parts. The first part consisted of actually setting up the Jupyter Notebook and Mongo Database. The second part consisted of updating the database by configuring certain data types, as well as making an addition into the documents. The third and final part consisted of running an exploratory analysis.

### Main_Script
This directory holds the Jupyter Notebook files used in this project, as well as a Resources folder that contains the json file that hold all of the data analyzed in this project.

#### [NoSQL_setup_starter](https://github.com/EdGonz44/nosql-challenge/blob/main/Main_Script/NoSQL_setup_starter.ipynb)
This Jupyter Notebook file acts as the initializer of the database used in this projects analysis. This file is responsible for the first two parts of the work done in this project. The first part focused on ensuring the database was properly imported into the file directory, and was correclty initialized within the Jupyter Notebook for further usage. The second part then involved adding a new entry (document) into the database, deleting documents with a local authority of Dover, and then modifying the datatypes of certain columns.

#### [NoSQL_analysis_starter](https://github.com/EdGonz44/nosql-challenge/blob/main/Main_Script/NoSQL_analysis_starter.ipynb)
This Jupyter Notebook file consists of the exploratory analysis of this project, i.e., part 3. This part focused primarily on answering 4 questions through the creation of a dataframe that would only hold the data that directly answered each question.
